    project description : To create a time log, a simple text editor which when pressed a button ( or click or whatever ) pastes the current time and date stamp and moves to next line with a tab so as to type in whats happening at the current time.

    decided to move on to sublime text extensions dev , as writing a text editor is little bit hard. Let the research begin...

    googled and found a js code to show the current date and time as "Monday, 25 December, 2017 - 07:37:40" neat... the only problem - its dynamic which means it keeps on updating like a clock. What i need is a "time stamp".

    7 hours passed and i wrote 15 lines of code :-(, but i reached somewhere i learned how to prpoperly implement static time using javascript. and created a button that when clicked will display the time stamp. i will figure out the styling part later...

    found out that the problem was really simple :-),just add the date function to the para div and it prints out date + ":" + text. simple as that.
